# Pale Blue Dot

_Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. ... -on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam._

-- Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot, 1994

On this website, you can view the latest images of Earth taken by NASA's EPIC ([Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera](https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/epic)). You can easily scroll back in time to view all images ever taken by the satellite dating back to October 2015. Just use your mouse scroll (or double finger scroll on touchpad) to load images of previous days and see the clouds swirling. Also click and drag left and right to rotate Earth.

If you find an interesting image you would like to share with others, just copy paste the url from your browser's address bar. The url always updates based on the image you are viewing: it contains the date and a longitude (the latter specifies from which direction Earth was photographed).

For example on the image from 2016 October 4th (http://napszel.com/palebluedot/#2016-10-04/-76.235588) you can see the Matthew hurricane forming north to South America. If you scroll UP with your mouse you can see the same hurricane reaching Florida in a few days.

Because of the unique perspective of the camera you can even view the Moon crossing in front of Earth at times. For example on 2016 July 5th: http://napszel.com/palebluedot/#2016-07-05/109

If you don't have a mouse available (for example on mobile), use the circle and triangle buttons under and next to the date header.
