ideas:
- download today's pic from epic
- show europe/america (switch)
- mouse scroll down scrolls to previous day's images
- full black bg, image in the middle, full size
- most simplest UI ever
- show date of current image, that is clickable to select other date but doesn't look so clickable
- info link, super tiny
- hidden buttons?

comments:
- epic images for one day: search for the one which has lon closest to 13-25 to see europe
- example image link: https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/epic-archive/jpg/epic_1b_20170618113111_02.jpg
- if there is no image for current day then skip
