ideas:
- download all pics for today from epic + some for previous days
- show europe/america by default -> geo location
- top shows all the rest of the images for current day
- mouse over on those thumbnails shows that image in big -> can rotate earth
- mouse scroll down scrolls to previous day's images but keeps the current earth rotation

- full black bg, image in the middle, full size
- most simplest UI ever
- show date of current image, that is clickable to select other date but doesn't look so clickable
- info link, super tiny
- hidden buttons?

comments:
- epic images for one day: search for the one which has lon closest to 13-25 to see europe
- is it enough to load the same index image for that day when scrolling?
- example image link: https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/epic-archive/jpg/epic_1b_20170618113111_02.jpg
- if there is no image for current day then skip
