<h3 id="being-a-nasa-datanaut"><a class="header-link" href="#being-a-nasa-datanaut"></a>Being a NASA Datanaut</h3>
<p><a href="https://open.nasa.gov/explore/datanauts/">NASA Datanauts</a> is a community of volunteer data scientists who work with <a href="https://open.nasa.gov/open-data/">NASA&#39;s open data</a> to solve data challenges. Every half a year the Datanauts founding class welcomes 50 newcomers to join the community to advance their data science skills. Datanauts engage with each other and subject matter experts, listen to presentations, learn by completing challenges and work on their own projects.</p>
<p>I joined Datanauts as a member of the <a href="https://open.nasa.gov/explore/datanauts/2017/spring/">2017 Spring Class</a>. As my project I decided to work with the images taken by NASA&#39;s <a href="https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/epic">Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera</a> (EPIC).</p>
<p>This camera takes multiple colored images every day of the entire sunlit face of the Earth. The spacecraft is located at the Earth-Sun Lagrange-1 (L-1) point giving EPIC a unique angular perspective. It has a field of view of 0.62 degrees, which is sufficient to image the entire Earth. Its distance from our planet also allows it to capture Moon transits.</p>
<h3 id="the-pale-blue-dot-project"><a class="header-link" href="#the-pale-blue-dot-project"></a>The Pale Blue Dot project</h3>
<p>The goal of <a href="http://palebluedot.napszel.com">Pale Blue Dot</a> was to create a web page where the hundreds of images taken by EPIC can be viewed in an intuitive and enjoyable way. The main requirements set were the following:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Mobile compatible web page.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No user interface clutter: not even buttons are needed to navigate.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The possibility to see the images almost full screen: as big as possible.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A very responsive experience: minimal waiting time if any.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These will hopefully ensure that rather than getting lost in the UI the users can submerge in the experience instead.</p>
<p>The final UI of the Pale Blue Dot project website looks like this:</p>

<h3 id="about-this-document"><a class="header-link" href="#about-this-document"></a>About this document</h3>
<p>Even though at first sight the project might look easy and straight forward, actually many things had to be considered and implemented both on the front end and the back end to make sure that the goals were achieved.</p>
<p>In this document you can read about all the problems that have risen and their solutions in detail. It aims to be understandable by anyone with minimal computer science knowledge.</p>

<h3 id="1.-javascript-ux/ui"><a class="header-link" href="#1.-javascript-ux/ui"></a>1. JavaScript UX/UI</h3>
<hr>
<p>The first version of the project was pure Javascript that directly talked to NASA&#39;s servers. At this stage the focus was on perfecting the User Experience.</p>
<h4 id="1.1.-navigation---no-buttons-necessary"><a class="header-link" href="#1.1.-navigation---no-buttons-necessary"></a>1.1. Navigation - no buttons necessary</h4>
<p> Instead of buttons and sliders you can scroll with your mouse (or touchpad) to go back in time and load older images. To rotate Earth you can naturally click and drag it. Similarly on mobile: use finger swipe up/down and left/right to change date and rotate Earth.</p>
<p> Additionally, discrete UI buttons (dots and arrows) are also available for precise navigation.</p>
<p> <img src="scrolling-earth.png" onClick="playGif('scrolling-earth')" alt="scrolling-earth" title="Scrolling in time">   <img src="rotating-earth.png" onClick="playGif('rotating-earth')" alt="rotating-earth" title="Rotating Earth with mouse drag"></p>
<p> The UI allows both fast and slow navigation: a small scroll/swipe or arrow click changes the date just by one day. With a few fast scrolls/swipes you can easily go back to images of the past year. </p>
<p> To make sure that every user action has an instant feedback on the UI, a fast scroll will instantly update the date label to show the currently selected date. Even if the user has to wait a little for the images to load.</p>
<h4 id="1.2.-url-handling---edit-the-links"><a class="header-link" href="#1.2.-url-handling---edit-the-links"></a>1.2. URL handling - edit the links</h4>
<p> The Website&#39;s URL has the format <em>palebluedot.napszel.com/#2017-06-06/29</em>. That is: a hashmark followed by a date (separated by dashes) followed by a slash and a longitude number. Navigating to this URL will display an Earth image taken on 2017 June 6th showing Europe/Africa (longitude 29). You may copy-paste such paths for sharing.</p>
<p> You are also free to edit the URLs to achieve fast and precise navigation. The application will search for the images taken on the supplied date (or if there are no images on the given day then the closest earlier date). Then it will search for the Earth rotation that is closest to the supplied longitude.</p>
<p> You may also enter only a date (<em>palebluedot.napszel.com/#2017-12-19</em>) or only a longitude (<em>palebluedot.napszel.com/#29</em>). In that case the other will take a default value (&#39;today&#39; for date and &#39;29&#39; for longitude). If neither (<em>palebluedot.napszel.com</em>) or &#39;latest&#39; (<em>palebluedot.napszel.com/#latest</em>) is given then both takes the default value which results in the latest image of Europe/Africa.</p>
<h4 id="1.3.-updating-the-url---share-the-links"><a class="header-link" href="#1.3.-updating-the-url---share-the-links"></a>1.3. Updating the URL - share the links</h4>
<p> As explained above, if the URL is edited by the user the application catches this event and the UI is loaded accordingly. The opposite also had to be implemented: if the UI changes based on user action the fragment identifiers in the URL have to be edited. </p>
<p> For example if the user navigates back one day from the latest images then the path will change from <em>palebluedot.napszel.com/#latest</em> to <em>palebluedot.napszel.com/#2018-01-14/29</em> in case this happened on Jan 16th.</p>
<p> The path is continuously kept up to date with every image change. This means that the path always specifies exactly that single image that is currently shown on the screen. It is enough to copy and paste the URL in the browser window to share a specific image with a friend.</p>
<p> Note that not every day has images. For example 2018 Jan 15th had none (but the day before and the day after had). Going back one day from Jan 16th will skip 15th and update the date on the UI and in the path to Jan 14th and load those images.</p>
<h4 id="1.4.-browser's-back-and-forward-buttons"><a class="header-link" href="#1.4.-browser's-back-and-forward-buttons"></a>1.4. Browser&#39;s Back and Forward buttons</h4>
<p> The application does not load different html resources when navigating on the UI. This means that the browser&#39;s Back and Forward buttons do nothing by default. For them to work, the application has to manually push addresses to the browser&#39;s history.</p>
<p> For example, in case you go back one day in time, the application will edit the date part of the path (explained in the previous point) and push it to history. Now if you click the browser&#39;s Back button, you are taken back to today.</p>
<p> <img src="chrome-history.png" alt="chrome-history" title="History example from Chrome"></p>
<p>  But not all navigation results in a path editing and history update. Consider the case where the user scrolls back 10 days very quickly with a mouse scroll or finger swipe. In this case if the path were edited to all dates during the scroll the browser&#39;s history would be polluted with day references which the user did not really have the time to look at (the images might have been not even loaded). To circumvent this, the path is only updated and pushed to history after you spend at least 500 ms viewing a day.</p>
<h4 id="1.5.-history---updating-the-title-of-the-page"><a class="header-link" href="#1.5.-history---updating-the-title-of-the-page"></a>1.5. History - updating the title of the page</h4>
<p> Browsers save your page visits in a list called history. If you check this list, you will see that it only shows the <em>title</em> of each page you visited.</p>
<p> In order to have meaningful history items for Pale Blue Dot the page&#39;s title is always edited according to the date/longitude selected (similarly how the URL is also edited). This way, instead of seeing ~ Pale Blue Dot ~, ~ Pale Blue Dot ~, ~ Pale Blue Dot ~ you see meaningful results.</p>
<p> <img src="history.png" alt="history" title="History of page"></p>
<h4 id="1.6.-preserving-selected-longitude"><a class="header-link" href="#1.6.-preserving-selected-longitude"></a>1.6. Preserving selected longitude</h4>
<p> Scrolling up and down between days preserves the longitude setting. This means that if you are viewing the European continent and then navigate to previous days, the application will always select the images closest to the European continent in previous days also.</p>
<p> But what if there are no close matches? For example on the day of the August 21st 2017 solar eclipse, multiple images were taken of the American continent to capture the event but none of Europe. If you are viewing an image of Europe from 22nd August and scroll to 21st of August the application will &quot;jump&quot; to the American continent. This is inevitable. However, if you continue going back one more day in August you will see Europe again.</p>
<p> This allows a nice way for example to scroll through a year and see how Europe changes during the seasons. Even if there are occasional jumps east and west. If this feature was not implemented the view point of Earth would seemingly jump around randomly and not return to the user&#39;s original longitude request.</p>
<p> To achieve this experience the longitude part of the URL is <em>not</em> updated in case of date changes. The longitude number seen in the path is only a &quot;goal&quot; longitude. Meaning that the image shown by the app is <em>the closest</em> image to that longitude but not necessarily the exact match. </p>
<p> Longitudes are only updated by the app in case the user <em>rotates</em> the earth left or right with click and drag or finger swipe. After this event the longitude is updated in the path and becomes the new &quot;goal&quot; longitude.</p>
<h4 id="1.7.-css-media-query---try-it-on-mobile"><a class="header-link" href="#1.7.-css-media-query---try-it-on-mobile"></a>1.7. CSS media query - try it on mobile</h4>
<p> Mobile screens are naturally smaller and required a slightly different UI arrangement to fit everything on screen. CSS media queries were used to change the layout for any screen below 670px.</p>
<p> Screenshot of the UI design on mobile device:</p>
<p> <img src="mobile-ui-screenshot.png" alt="mobile-ui-screenshot" title="Scrolling in time"> </p>
<p> Since the threshold for &quot;too small screen&quot; is based on browser window size and not based on device type, the same rearranging of the UI happens on a regular desktop too if the browser window is shrunk. </p>
<h3 id="2.-serving-the-assets"><a class="header-link" href="#2.-serving-the-assets"></a>2. Serving the assets</h3>
<hr>
<p>After the User Interface is ready and the navigation is intuitive, comes the question of <em>speed</em>. An interactive UI that is enjoyable responds to every user action within a second (if there is any way possible). Even if the implementation gives a simple way to change dates, if the new image takes 3-5 seconds to load, it will quickly bore the user and hinder a positive experience. </p>
<p><em>Especially</em>, if the UI gives options to change views very quickly, the site has to be responsive. If the users were to change date with a date selector, they might be more forgiving in waiting time. However, one of the goals of the project was to be able to enjoy these beautiful cloudy Earth images swirling, so waiting time was not something I wanted to compromise on.</p>
<p class="img-container"><img src="swirls.png" onClick="playGif('swirls')" alt="swirls" title="Swirling clouds"></p>
<h4 id="2.1.-the-nasa-server's-json-files"><a class="header-link" href="#2.1.-the-nasa-server's-json-files"></a>2.1. The NASA server&#39;s JSON files</h4>
<p>NASA stores these images on the server <em>epic.gsfc.nasa.gov</em> which accepts requests through an open API. To find out the available images (names and many other information) for a given day, you can request a JSON file. This means you have to download one JSON file to show the images of one day. For example part of the JSON file for 2015-10-31:</p>

]</code></pre><p>This extract shows the information for <em>one image</em> of the given date. The camera might take as many as 22 images per day. A full JSON file for such day is around 22 kilobytes which can take up to 1 second to download on fast internet and up to 3 seconds on slower one in Europe (results should be better closer to the server in USA and worse in Asia).

<h4 id="2.2.-serving-the-json-files"><a class="header-link" href="#2.2.-serving-the-json-files"></a>2.2. Serving the JSON files</h4>
<p>The JSON files provided by NASA contained too many unnecessary information for my project and is serviced too slow for the UX I had in mind. See in the previous file example - marked with asterisks - the 3 data that I actually need for one image: name, longitude and date. </p>
<p>To improve on speed the JSON files were compacted and serviced from our own server. </p>
<p>To shrink the JSON files the images are grouped together by date. This way only a list of name-longitude pairs are left. When the days are also grouped together in one singe JSON file we get this format:</p>

]</code></pre><p>This extract shows the information for <em>one day</em> with 21 images. The rest of the days would follow after. So instead of having one JSON file for one day we have one JSON file for <em>all data</em> (all days). Roughly storing the same amount of information for <em>one day</em> as for <em>one image</em> before.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this document the full JSON file with all the days concatenated together from the beginning of EPIC&#39;s life is 418 kilobytes. This <em>single file</em> is enough to be downloaded <em>once</em> by the application - right at page load - and serves every later data request in an <em>instant</em>.</p>
<h4 id="2.3.-scripts-for-the-json-files"><a class="header-link" href="#2.3.-scripts-for-the-json-files"></a>2.3. Scripts for the JSON files</h4>
<p>To serve this JSON file from our server (an Amazon Web Services virtual machine) the following scripts were implemented:</p>
<p> a. A <a href="https://github.com/NASADatanauts/PaleBlueDot/blob/master/backend-scripts/download-recent-jsons.sh">Bash script that downloads</a> recent JSON files from NASA server.</p>
<p> b. A <a href="https://github.com/NASADatanauts/PaleBlueDot/blob/master/backend-scripts/fix-nasajson.py">Python script that sorts</a> each daily JSON file based on coordinates.</p>
<p> c. A <a href="https://github.com/NASADatanauts/PaleBlueDot/blob/master/backend-scripts/nasajsons-to-allnasa.py">Python script that concatenates</a> the sorted daily JSON files into one single JSON file sorted by date (in the format shown above).</p>
<p> d. A <a href="https://github.com/NASADatanauts/PaleBlueDot/blob/master/backend-scripts/daily.sh">Bash script that runs</a> all of the above in order.</p>
<p> e. And finally a cronjob that runs the previous Bash script daily.</p>
<h4 id="2.4.-image-sizes-and-download-times"><a class="header-link" href="#2.4.-image-sizes-and-download-times"></a>2.4. Image sizes and download times</h4>
<p>The reformatting and serving of the JSON file improved on speed significantly but the huge size of the images were still making the UX too slow.</p>
<p>NASA gives options to download the images in 3 formats:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>png, 2048x2048 pixels, ~3Mb file size</li>
<li>jpg, 1080x1080 pixels, ~190Kb file size</li>
<li>jpg, 120x120 pixels, thumbnail</li>
</ul>
<p>The thumbnails are obviously not big enough to shown in full screen. Out of the other two formats, even the smaller jpg format takes around 1.5 seconds to download for a user in Europe even on a gigabit internet.</p>
<p>This is partly because of the distance to the NASA server: a user from Europe will experience a minimum of 200 ms delay. Because of the size of the images this goes up to 1.5 s in total download time. In the USA this should be around 1 s but even worse than 1.5 s in Asia. We are talking about <em>one</em> image of a particular day.</p>
<p>Waiting around 1 second every time the user tries to navigate around the images results in a sluggish user experience instead of an interactive UI.</p>
<h4 id="2.5.-serving-the-images---maxcdn"><a class="header-link" href="#2.5.-serving-the-images---maxcdn"></a>2.5. Serving the images - MaxCDN</h4>
<p>To solve the delay problem for users located far from the only NASA server a <em>Content Distribution Network</em> (CDN) comes to mind. That is, a geographically distributed network of servers that store the NASA images and then services the requests spatially relative to users.</p>
<p>It is possible to buy such CDN services for a relatively small monthly fee. However, it is important to understand the different solutions they offer and to pick the correct one for the project to actually make it faster.</p>
<p>The most common feature a CDN service will offer is a so called <em>CDN pull zone</em>. This means they &quot;pull&quot; the static assets from your project to cache it and serve it from their CDN Network. However, &quot;pulling&quot; only happens if an asset is requested by a user and the cache is cleared usually after 24 hours. This kind of CDN is useful for websites with many visits, requesting the same assets over and over again.</p>
<p>It is easy to see that for the images of the Pale Blue Dot project this would not be of much use. After a user loads the images of today, they have hundreds of other options for images they might want to load next. So it is very unlikely that even two users will request the same assets and so they would not see see any advantage of a pull zone.</p>
<p>What the Pale Blue Dot project needed was a much less common feature, called a <em>CDN push zone</em>. The only service found (middle of 2017) that offered this feature was <a href="https://www.maxcdn.com/">MaxCDN</a>. A MaxCDN push zone gives you the option to directly upload your files to a server which is then synced out to the distribution network. So even the first user gets serviced fast and the assets never get cleared like caches on a pull zone.</p>
<p>Having the huge images and the optimized JSON file in a Content Distribution Network (updated and pushed every night) maximally optimized the download speed of assets, for every user, anywhere in the world. The download times of images went <em>below</em>  0.5 sec (for users with a gigabit internet) which gives a smooth user experience navigating between any of the Earth images. This would have been impossible with the NASA provided API.</p>
<h4 id="2.6.-scripts-for-maxcdn"><a class="header-link" href="#2.6.-scripts-for-maxcdn"></a>2.6. Scripts for MaxCDN</h4>
<p>To serve the images and the JSON file from a MaxCDN push zone the following scripts were implemented and added to our own server (an Amazon Web Services virtual machine):</p>
<p>a. A <a href="https://github.com/NASADatanauts/PaleBlueDot/blob/master/backend-scripts/download-images-for-day.sh">Bash script that downloads</a> all new images daily.</p>
<p>b. A <a href="https://github.com/NASADatanauts/PaleBlueDot/blob/master/backend-scripts/upload-day.sh">Bash script that pushes</a> the images to MaxCDN.</p>
<p>c. A <a href="https://github.com/NASADatanauts/PaleBlueDot/blob/master/backend-scripts/upload-allnasa.sh">Bash script that pushes</a> our reformatted JSON file to MaxCDN.</p>
<h3 id="3.-image-manipulation"><a class="header-link" href="#3.-image-manipulation"></a>3. Image manipulation</h3>
<hr>
<p>The user experience on a gigabit internet is flawless at this point with the minimized, single JSON file and assets distributed from a CDN. But of course not everybody has a gigabit internet. Even if you do, you might be travelling or on mobile data.</p>
<p>There is nothing really left to optimize on the server, it services the JSON file and images as fast as it is possible. The only thing left to improve is the size of the images it has to service.</p>
<h4 id="3.1.-individual-thumbnails"><a class="header-link" href="#3.1.-individual-thumbnails"></a>3.1. Individual thumbnails</h4>
<p>The idea is to show a smaller resolution version of the requested image (stretched to full size) in place of the real one until the full resolution image loads. </p>
<p>The goal is to make these initial thumbnail images small enough that the application is able to instantly respond to user interaction with them (less than a second of download time even on <em>mobile</em> internet) but also big enough that the user sees what they are looking at.</p>
<p>There are thumbnails provided by the NASA API but they are so low resolution that they looked unacceptable when stretched to full screen.</p>
<p>This is an example of a NASA provided thumbnail stretched to 1024x1024 (5 KB):</p>
<p class="img-container"><img src="thumbnail-nasa-big.png" alt="thumbnail-nasa-big" title="Nasa thumbnail example"></p>
<p>However, with a little image conversion (with the <a href="https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/1-ImageMagick/">ImageMagick tool</a>) the Pale Blue Dot project generates their own thumbnails which are only 3 KBs more in size but looking much better in 1024x1024:</p>
<p class="img-container"><img src="thumbnail-big.jpg" alt="thumbnail-big" title="PBD thumbnail example"></p>
<p>The download time for these thumbnails are 20 ms on a gigabit internet and 600 ms on 3G. The latter is already fast enough that it provides a smooth user experience.</p>
<h4 id="3.2.-concatenated-thumbnails"><a class="header-link" href="#3.2.-concatenated-thumbnails"></a>3.2. Concatenated thumbnails</h4>
<p>But there is still in improvement that removes some of those 20-600ms waiting times.</p>
<p>The second improvement idea came from the assumption that once a user loaded a specific date they might be interested in all or some of the other images of the same day too. E.g. they will drag and rotate Earth around.</p>
<p>To make sure that Earth rotations cause absolutely no delay, there is an additional image download that starts in the background when a user is spending time on a date: a concatenated image of all thumbnail images for one particular day. See example of this below.</p>
<p class="img-container"><img src="thumbnail-concatenated.jpg" alt="thumbnail-concatenated" title="Thumbnails concatenated"></p>
<p>This image is &quot;cut and zoomed in&quot; when the user rotates the Earth. This means that once this image is downloaded, the user is free to rotate Earth left and right with 0 delay and no network request. Even if the user loses internet connection they can still enjoy the current days images.</p>
<p>These concatenated thumbnails are around ~60KB depending on how many images were taken on that day. This takes 40 ms to download on gigabit internet and around 1.2 s on slow mobile internet.</p>
<h4 id="3.3.-big-image"><a class="header-link" href="#3.3.-big-image"></a>3.3. Big image</h4>
<p>All of the above image manipulation with smaller resolution images is only needed to make sure that the user experience is smooth and without any visible waiting time. But at the end of the day, the app has to download and display a full screen version of the image requested.</p>
<p>As mentioned before the NASA API provides 1080x1080 pixel image files that are around 190 Kb each. These are the images that you see on the official <a href="https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/">EPIC website</a>.</p>
<p>Also, the NASA API provides &quot;full resolution&quot; image downloads that are 2048x2048 in pixels and around 3 Mbs in size. The EPIC website lets you to download these with a button but doesn&#39;t display them. This is a good choice as downloading and attempting to display such big resolution images would be unnecessary as it would use considerable amount of network traffic and most screens would have to shrink it anyway as they do not fit on screen.</p>
<p>The Pale Blue Dot website works similarly to the official EPIC Website as it also displays 1024x1024 images in full screen and only offers a <em>download button</em> for the twice as big full resolution images (see point 3.7). However, it achieves a 40% reduction in image size for the displayed full screen images with no visible quality loss.</p>
<p>Pale Blue Dot downloads the biggest resolution images (the 2048x2048 ones) daily at night, then converts them (with the <a href="https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/1-ImageMagick/">ImageMagick tool</a>) to a smaller jpg version that is 1024x1024 pixels and only around 120 Kb in size. Which is even smaller than the NASA API provided full size jpg images but result in no visible quality loss.</p>
<p>See below the Pale Blue Dot generated 1024x1024 pixels jpg that is 115 Kb in size. Hover image to see the NASA API provided 1080x1080 jpg which is 195 Kb. See any quality loss?
<img src="pbd_full.jpg" alt="pbd-full" title="Pale Blue Dot jpg" onmouseover="this.src='nasa_full.jpg'" onmouseout="this.src='pbd_full.jpg'"/>
</p>
<h4 id="3.4.-scripts-for-image-manipulation"><a class="header-link" href="#3.4.-scripts-for-image-manipulation"></a>3.4. Scripts for image manipulation</h4>
<p>To generate the previously described <em>thumbnails</em> the <em>concatenated images</em> and the optimzed <em>big images</em> the following scripts were implemented and added to our own server (an Amazon Web Services virtual machine):</p>
<p>a. A <a href="https://github.com/NASADatanauts/PaleBlueDot/blob/master/backend-scripts/resize-images-for-day.sh">Bash script that generates</a> the needed thumbnails.</p>
<p>b. A [magic script that concatenates] (<a href="https://github.com/NASADatanauts/PaleBlueDot/blob/master/backend-scripts/concat.scans">https://github.com/NASADatanauts/PaleBlueDot/blob/master/backend-scripts/concat.scans</a>) the thumbnails.</p>
<p>c. A <a href="https://github.com/NASADatanauts/PaleBlueDot/blob/master/backend-scripts/save-images-for-day.sh">Bash script that saves</a> the images generated by the previous two scripts.</p>
<p>d. A <a href="https://github.com/NASADatanauts/PaleBlueDot/blob/master/backend-scripts/do-image-for-day.sh">Bash script that runs</a> all of the above in order.</p>
<h4 id="3.5.-parallel-loading"><a class="header-link" href="#3.5.-parallel-loading"></a>3.5. Parallel loading</h4>
<p>As hinted before, all image downloads happen in parallel. When a user stops on a particular image of a particular day the following image downloads start in parallel:</p>
<p>a. Small thumbnail of the image of date/longitude; ~8 Kb, ~20ms-600ms
b. Full size version of the image of date/longitude; ~120 Kb; 50-2600ms
c. Concatenated thumbnails of images of date; ~60 Kb, 40-1200ms</p>
<p>The user sees the small thumbnail first (a). This is almost instant. The full size version of the same image is downloading in the background. As soon as it is loaded (b) it replaces the small resolution image. During these two downloads, the concatenated thumbnails were also downloading in the background (c). Once that is finished, there is no download time to show Earth from any point of view on that day.</p>
<h4 id="3.6.-cancelling-of-obsolete"><a class="header-link" href="#3.6.-cancelling-of-obsolete"></a>3.6. Cancelling of obsolete</h4>
<p>Modern browser are built in with a feature that cancels downloads that became unnecessary. For example, if the DOM element that caused the request got deleted or one particular object&#39;s source were overwritten with a new resource. In both cases the original resource&#39;s download can be canceled as it will surely no longer be needed. </p>
<p>To make sure that the Pale Blue Dot website takes advantage of this feature, the full resolution images are loaded into the same object. This means that if you navigate away from a date before the image has been loaded the obsolete request is cancelled and the currently needed image&#39;s download is started instead.</p>
<p>See a screenshot of Google Chrome&#39;s network logging. All the red lines show cancelled downloads of images of days that the user quickly skipped over.</p>
<p class="img-container"><img src="cancelled.png" alt="cancelled"></p>
<p>This also means that scrolling through a bulk of images from different days does not accumulate downloads and so, does not lag the UI. Loading a day from a year before takes the same amount of time as loading today&#39;s images.</p>
<h4 id="3.7.-download-biggest-resolution-image"><a class="header-link" href="#3.7.-download-biggest-resolution-image"></a>3.7. Download biggest resolution image</h4>
<p>At this point the shown images are fully optimized for maximum speed and usability. However, if speed is not an issue then having access to the best quality images can come in handy.</p>
<p>For this reason, the UI has a download button under each image that opens the biggest resolution image, directly from NASA&#39;s EPIC website. You can right click and select &quot;Save Link As...&quot; to download the 2048x2048 image to your computer or left click to open it in a new browser tab to view it full size.</p>
<h3 id="4.-improvements-rundown"><a class="header-link" href="#4.-improvements-rundown"></a>4. Improvements rundown</h3>
<p>To visualise the improvements, here are the download sizes and download times needed to display <em>one</em> single random image after page load. Comparing NASA API supported options to features implemented by Pale Blue Dot.</p>

<p>Note that NASA API&#39;s download times depend also on geographical location of the user as well as internet speed. The download time shown here is the <em>minimum</em> time needed even on gigabit internet. Pale Blue Dot download times only depend on internet speed of the user because of the MaxCDN solution explained in point 2.5.</p>
<p>Also note that Pale Blue Dot does not require to download a JSON file to display a new image because of the restructuring of the file seen in point 2.2.</p>
<p>Finally, because of the image thumbnail pre loading of Pale Blue Dot (seen in point 3.1) the download time results are about the same on mobile internet as on gigabit internet. The difference will be in the initial <em>quality</em> of the image rather than longer waiting time.</p>
<h3 id="5.-error-reporting---trackjs"><a class="header-link" href="#5.-error-reporting---trackjs"></a>5. Error reporting - TrackJS</h3>
<hr>
<p>To make sure that the quality of the website is kept over time and users from all type of Operating Systems and Web Browsers can enjoy it, an error reporting system has been integrated into the code.</p>
<p>The error reporting tool that was chosen is called <a href="https://trackjs.com">TrackJS</a>. It reports every javascript error that occurs  to any user. Error reports are logged together with stacktrace, OS/Browser details and some other statistics.</p>
<h4 id="5.1.-catching-errors"><a class="header-link" href="#5.1.-catching-errors"></a>5.1. Catching errors</h4>
<p>For example, there was a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax">Spread syntax</a> in the first version of the javascript code. But one day, TrackJS sent a notification that this particular line caused an error for a user who was using a specific OS with a specific browser. So rather than never finding out about this issue, the code was quickly refactored and hopefully one user gained back and other future users never lost.</p>
<h4 id="5.2.-debugging"><a class="header-link" href="#5.2.-debugging"></a>5.2. Debugging</h4>
<p>An other useful specialty of TrackJS that the Pale Blue Dot project is using is the <em>trackjs.console.log</em>. You have the option to push logs to TrackJS that does not show up in the browsers&#39; console window (or anywhere else for that matter) but TrackJS stores it for your project, you just need a trick to access it. This allows to have an instant &quot;debug&quot; feature the following way:</p>
<p>When an error is caught by TrackJS, it will be displayed on your Dashboard together with the most recent trackjs.console.logs. So simply any error has to be triggered to get access to your debug logs. For this reason if you edit the URL of Pale Blue Dot to contain the word <em>debug</em>, you will see a deliberate error in the console &quot;trackjs debug push&quot;:</p>
<p class="img-container"><img src="debug.png" alt="debug" title="Debugging with TrackJS"></p>
<p>...and now, TrackJS Dashboard will show that there has been an error with some debug logs around it:</p>
<p class="img-container"><img src="trackJS.png" alt="trackJS" title="TrackJS error example"></p>
<p>I use this feature to log some image download times. For example, if while travelling and testing the website from different locations/browsers, something suspicious happens I can trigger a debug. This causes TrackJS to log the event together with statistics so later it can be viewed and examined.</p>
